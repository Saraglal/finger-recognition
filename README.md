# Finger Recognition

Fingerprint recognition systems work by examining a finger pressed against a smooth surface. The fingerâ€™s ridges and valleys are scanned, and a series of distinct points, where ridges and valleys end or meet, are called minutiae. These minutiae are the points the fingerprint recognition system uses for comparison. In order to identify an individual, the valleys (minutiae) and ridges are used which are found on the surface tips of a human finger.

The Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) is a computer vision algorithm to detect, describe and match local feature in images commonly known as the key points of the image, these key points are scale & rotation invariant that can be used for various computer vision applications.
